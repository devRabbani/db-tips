- Add indexes to frequently queried columns to speed up lookups and joins.
- Use normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- Analyze and optimize slow queries with EXPLAIN plans.
- Use connection pooling to manage and reuse database connections efficiently.
- Split large tables into smaller partitions to improve performance.
- Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and latency.
- Perform regular backups to protect against data loss.
- Adjust database configuration settings for optimal performance based on workload.
- Employ transactions to ensure data consistency and rollback on errors.
- Continuously monitor and analyze database performance metrics to identify and address bottlenecks.
