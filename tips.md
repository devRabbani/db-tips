- Add indexes to frequently queried columns to speed up lookups and joins.
- Use normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- Analyze and optimize slow queries with EXPLAIN plans.
- Use connection pooling to manage and reuse database connections efficiently.
- Split large tables into smaller partitions to improve performance.
- Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and latency.
- Perform regular backups to protect against data loss.
- Adjust database configuration settings for optimal performance based on workload.
- Employ transactions to ensure data consistency and rollback on errors.
- Continuously monitor and analyze database performance metrics to identify and address bottlenecks.

- Use foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.
- Select the most suitable data types for columns to optimize storage and improve performance.
- Specify only necessary columns in queries.
- Regularly adjust and remove unused indexes.
- Consider selective denormalization for read performance.
- Use stored procedures for complex operations to reduce network traffic and improve security.
- Manage locking strategies to prevent deadlocks.
- Keep database statistics updated to help the query planner make informed decisions.
- Use read replicas to handle read-heavy loads.
- Schedule regular maintenance like reindexing.
- Regularly refactor your database schema to keep it efficient and aligned with evolving application needs.
